this is going to be a pub roulette app 

it will have a expess middleware that calls a api - foursquare venues API to provide a way for you to plan a pub crawl start point in the current location or post code provided. 

the user can input the number of pubs that they want to vist

I want to use the google geoloctor directions and maps to design a pub crawl after the random starting pub 

there should be directions to the first pub from the users location. the the directions will be provided to the others. 

the pubs should be listed - with info, if user clicks on a specific pub they should be given the option to skip the preceding pubs, and the directions and list changes accondingly. 

user stories and personas will be worked on

tech going to be use
- react native  
- express 
- mongodb or firebase for user auth 
- css modules 
- css animations 
- webpack 
- es6 
- google maps/ geolocator/ directions
